          I am a Full-Stack developer living in Queens. From a young age I've
          had a keen interest in coding and technology in general. One of my
          early childhood dreams was to be a YouTuber reviewing high-end
          consumer technology. My technical skills include Javascript, REACT,
          SQL. This website was a collaborative effort with some friends,
          competent programmers in their own right, but I have done numerous
          solo projects that showcases my technical acumen. Please refer to my
          Github for examples.If you have any questions or professional
          interest, I can be found at <br />

        <p>
          I began a career in technology by obtaining a COMPTIA Network+
          certification. This led me to become an associate at Geek Squad for
          three years. I eventually steered towards the installation Mobile
          Electronics in vehicles instead of applying technological concepts &
          programming languages with computers, which is what I really desired.I
          found the Pursuit Fellowship Organization and began my path to
          becoming a Javascript developer with currently working with the PERN
          Stack for web development. I can be found at <br />
