          I began a career in technology by obtaining a COMPTIA Network+
          certification. This led me to become an associate at Geek Squad for
          three years. I eventually steered towards the installation Mobile
          Electronics in vehicles instead of applying technological concepts &
          programming languages with computers, which is what I really desired.I
          found the Pursuit Fellowship Organization and began my path to
          becoming a Javascript developer.
